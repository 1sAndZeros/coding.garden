      <h1 class="center">So you want to join the <span class="green">Coding Garden</span> Discord?</h1>
      <h3 class="center yellow">There are a few things you will need to do!</h3>
      <ol>
        <li class="red">Read this entire message. Seriously. Read it.</li>
        <li>Click the button at the bottom of the page to Join the Discord. (Sign up for a discord account if you have
          not yet!)</li>
        <li>After joining the server, you will have <span class="red">read only access</span>, and will only see a few
          channels. You will need to <span class="red">complete steps 4-6</span> to gain <span class="green">full
            access</span> to the server:</li>
        <li>Read the ENTIRE <span class="purple">#üëãwelcome</span> channel message including the <span class="yellow">Code
            of Conduct</span>. If english is not your first language, we have several <span
            class="red">translations</span> of the <span class="purple">#üëãwelcome</span> channel message and the <span class="yellow">Code
              of Conduct</span> available <a
            href="https://github.com/CodingGarden/discord-welcome-code-of-conduct/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
        <li>After you have read the <span class="yellow">Code of Conduct</span> in the <span
            class="purple">#üëãwelcome</span> channel you will need to
          add an <span class="red">emoji reaction</span> to acknowledge that you will abide by the <span
            class="yellow">Code of Conduct</span>.</li>
        <li>
          After that, you will need to send an introduction in the <span class="purple">#üó£introductions</span> channel.
          Your introduction must be at least <span class="red">40 characters long</span>, but it can be anything you'd
          like us to know about you. Here are some questions to help you write your introduction message, (but you
          really can write anything!):
          <ul class="small">
            <li>What do you do? How long have you been coding? What's your favorite programming language? How did you
              find Coding Garden? What is your favorite thing about programming? What hobbies do you have? What's your
              favorite food? Do you have any pets?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After you have completed <span class="red">steps 4-6</span>, <span class="yellow">CG-BOT</span> will
          automatically add you to the seedling role and you will have <span class="green">full access</span> to the
          server! <span class="green">Congrats! üéâüéâ</span> Feel free to poke around. If you need help with something, be sure to read the <span class="yellow">#üìùread-first</span> channel before posting a question.</li>
